## Development & Building

This project uses `PyInstaller` to create executables. The build process is automated with GitHub Actions.

To build the application locally:

1.  Install build dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

2.  Run the build script:
    ```bash
    chmod +x build.sh
    ./build.sh
    ```
    The executable will be created in the `dist/` directory.
